There have been a few solutions that search and replace values in PDF files.  However, many of these solutions require you to create each and every report, for each and every affiliate, one by one, manually.With other solutions, the PDF file might still look the way you intended if you're lucky.  PDF's were not really designed to be edited after being published.  At xBrander, we've found a better way to brand and export near perfect PDF's for your affiliates.The xBrander plug-in is very easy to install, activate, and setup.  After the plug-in is configured with your unique API Key, you simply have to tell the plug-in what to search for and what to replace in your report files.An API Key is necessary to use the xBrander service.  A free level is available.Features* Copy-n-paste the xBrander shortcode to place the download form and button in any page or post.* Accurately reproduces your DOCX files as PDF's.  Virtually no glitches like other solutions.  Clickable images and footer links will even work like they should.* Works with any search values/codes in DOCX files. This saves you time if you already have your documents created for another branding service or software.* Works with most membership scripts to pre-populate replacement values.* Pre-populate replacement values with shortcodes, plain text, or use PHP to grab the value from virtually anywhere.* Let your affiliates change replacement values if you want before they download their branded PDF file.
